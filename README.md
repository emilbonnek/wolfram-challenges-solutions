# Wolfram challenges solutions
This repository has my solutions to some challenges from [challenges.wolfram.com](https://challenges.wolfram.com). They are all written using Mathematica and saved in the notebook format.

Each file represents a small challenge in programming and computational thinking. They differ in categories such as math, word puzzles, calendar and geography.
The beginning of the file describes the challenge and below it is my solution.
